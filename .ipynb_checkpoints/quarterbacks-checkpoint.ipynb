    "In the National Football League (NFL), a franchise's starting quarterback is often considered the most important position and player on the team. A quarterback in the NFL is tasked with directing the offense and being an extension of the coaching staff, whom call plays for the quarterback to relay to his team. Because of their critical importance to their team, a quarterback is often the highest paid player on his respective team. There is a narrative in the NFL that a team cannot excel without a good quarterback. With that said, our project aims to using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering to see whether or not we can separate quarterbacks into distinct tiers or clusters to see whether or not we can see what makes up an elite quarterback in the NFL."

    "- <b>Down (verb):</b> When the ball carrier is tackled to the ground by the defensive team. A player is considered to be down if any part of his body other than his hands or feet touch the ground while having contact with a defensive player. A ball carrier can also be considered down if he runs out of bounds.\n",
    "- <b>Down (noun):</b> A play. A team is given 4 sets of downs per offensive possession. \n",
    "- <b>First Down:</b> Advancing the ball 10 yards past the line of scrimmage. Obtaining a first down results in a fresh set of 4 downs for the offensive team. \n",
    "- <b>End Zone:</b> The area at the ends of the field where a team must cross into to score.\n",
    "- <b>Goal Line:</b> The line that designates the beginning of the endzone.\n",
    "- <b>Touchdown:</b> When a team gets into the opposing team's endzone. Touchdowns are worth 6 points.\n",

If the ball is recovered by the defensive team, it is a lost fumble and the defensive team now has possession. After a fumble, the next down is started at the spot where the football was recovered.  \n",
    "- <b>Turnover on Downs:</b> When a team fails to advance the ball 10 yards past the line of scrimmage. If a team punts the ball, it is not considered a turnover on downs.\n",
    "- <b>Audible:</b> When the quarterback changes the play at the line of scrimmage.\n",
    "- <b>Blitz:</b> When extra players, other than the defensive lineman, are sent to try to sack the quarterback.\n",
    "- <b>Lateral:</b> A pass thrown parallel to or in the backwards direction from a team's goal line.\n",
    "- <b>Red Zone:</b> When the offensive team is within 20 yards of the opposing team's endzone.\n",
    "- <b>Hail Mary:</b> A very long, desperation pass made in an attempt to score. Usually these passes occur at the end of games where the offensive team must score to win the game. Hail Marys are usually unsuccessful.\n",
    "- <b>Kickoff:</b> The start of a new possesion after the other team has scored. The team who just scored kicks the ball toward the other team's endzone.\n",
    "- <b>Onside Kick:</b> During a kickoff, a team may elect to kick the ball a very short distance in an attempt to get another offensive possession. The onside kick must travel at least 15 yards before players on the kicking team may touch the ball, but a kicking team player is allowed to touch the ball before the 15 yard distance if a player on the opposing team touches the ball first.\n",
    "- <b>Touchback:</b> When a punt or kickoff kick travels beyond the receiving team's endzone. The ball is placed on the team's own 25 yard line as a result of a touchback.\n",
    "- <b>Field Goal Range:</b> When a team is within the ideal range to attempt a field goal. Field goal range is usually around 50 yards from the goal posts as attempted field goals beyond this distance have lower conversion rates."

    "### Basics of Football\n",
    "\n",
    "In a football game, a team's objective is to move the football down the field with the main goal of reaching the other team's endzone, thus scoring a touchdown which is worth 6 points. A team can move the football through rushing or passing the football. A team is given 4 sets of down for each offensive possession and a fresh set of 4 downs are given everytime a team gets a first down. After scoring a touchdown, a team can either kick an extra point, a kick attempt from 33 yards out that is worth 1 point if converted or go for a 2-point conversion, one offensive play from the 2 yard line that is worth 2 points if the team reachs the endzone. If a team is unable to score a touchdown, they instead settle for a field goal, which is worth 3 points. A team can also commit a turnover through an interception, lost fumble, or a safety. If a team fails to obtain a first down after 3 downs, they can either punt the ball to the other team or \"go for it\" and try to obtain a first down on their 4th down. Failing to convert on 4th down results in giving possesion to the other team on the line of scrimmage. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a team is on defense, their objective is to stop the the other team from scoring. Being able to hold the opposing team to a field goal is considered satisfactory but ideally, a defense is able force the opposing team to punt or commit a turnover. Special teams are responsible to the change of possesion plays: kickoffs and punts. During kickoffs and punts, the kicking team is attempting to give the worst possible field position to the receiving team. The receiving team can either return the football (catch the kick and run it) in an attempt to gain better field position (or possibly score a touchdown), kneel in the endzone (resulting in a touchback), or call for a fair catch, resulting in the offense starting from the spot of the catch."

    "### Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Offensive:\n",
    "- <b>Quarterback</b>\n",
    "    - Considered the most important position on a football team. A quarterback relays the coaching staff's plays to the rest of the offense, however it is up to a quarterback to call an audible to change the play or run the designated play if he sees something in the other's teams defense formation. A quarterback can be lined up under the center or in shotgun. Quarterbacks mainly have three options when they receive the ball: make a forward pass, hand the ball off to the running back, or run the football themselves.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- <b>Running Back</b>\n",
    "    - Running backs are players who line up behind the line of scrimmage either behind or next to the quarterback depending on the play. They either are handed off the football by the quarterback to rush the football, block the pass-rushers on the other team, or leak out beyond the line of scrimmage to receive a checkdown from the quarterback.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- <b>Wide Receiver</b>\n",
    "    - Wide Receivers catch passes from the quarterback. The main objective is to run routes to get open for their quarterback to pass them the ball. A good wide receiver has good hands, and speed. Wide receivers can line up behind the line of scrimmage, out wide (outermost receiver on the line of scrimmage), or in the slot (in between the receiver out wide and the offensive line).\n",
    "- <b>Tight End</b>\n",
    "    - Tight Ends are considered to be hybrid players who can function as an extra blocker to protect the quarterback or run routs as a receiver. Most Tight Ends are blocking tight ends who only occasionally catch passes. The best tight ends in the NFL are good at both catching passes as well as blocking. Tight ends are usually targetted in the red zone as they are usually bigger and stronger than wide receivers with the average height and weight of a tight end being 6'3\" and 240 lbs, respectively. \n",
    "- <b>Center</b>\n",
    "    - The Center snaps the ball to the quarterback, thus starting the offensive play. Centers also block and protect the quarterback from being sacked. As part of the offensive line, they also block to open up running lanes on rushing plays.\n",
    "- <b>Right/Left Guard</b>\n",
    "    - Protects the quarterback from the opposing team's defensive tackles. As part of the offensive line, they also block to open up running lanes on rushing plays.\n",
    "- <b>Right/Left Tackle</b>\n",
    "    - Protects the quarterback from the opposing team's defensive ends. As part of the offensive line, they also block to open up running lanes on rushing plays.\n",
    "- <b>Fullback</b>\n",
    "    - An extra blocker that lines up behind the quarterback but in front of the running back. Because they are usually only used on rushing plays, their main objective is to help further clear lanes for the running back to run the ball, although they can also rush the ball and catch the ball if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Defensive:\n",
    "- <b>Defensive End</b>\n",
    "    - A defensive end rushes the passer and stops the opposing team's rusher from running around the outside of the line.\n",
    "- <b>Defensive Tackle</b>\n",
    "    - Similar to a defensive end, defensive tackles rush the passer and stop the opposing team's rusher from running through the middle on rushing plays.\n",
    "- <b>Middle Linebacker</b>\n",
    "    - Considered to the \"quarterback on defense\", middle linebackers primarily call the team's defensive plays and must be able adjust to multiple situations. Depending on the play, a middle linebacker may stop the running back if he has broken past the defensive line, cover the middle of the field on passing plays, or rush the passer on blitz plays.\n",
    "- <b>Outside Linebacker</b>\n",
    "    - Outside linebackers often cover tight ends on their routes, or rush the passer when the tight end is blocking to protect his quarterback. Outside linebackers are also responsible for stopping the running back if he has broken past the defensive end.\n",
    "- <b>Cornerback</b>\n",
    "    - Cornerbacks are responsible for covering the other team's opposing wide receiver and prevent them from catching passes from the opposing team's quarterback.\n",
    "- <b>Safety</b>\n",
    "    - Safetys are considered to be the last line of defense. Strong safetys are usually bigger and stronger and add a layer of extra protection on run plays while free safetys usually help cornerbacks with covering long pass plays. A free safety might help a cornerback double team an opposing team's number 1 wide receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Special Teams:\n",
    "- <b>Kicker</b>\n",
    "    - Responisble for kicking field goals and extra points. Some kickers also kick on kickoffs.\n",
    "- <b>Holder</b>\n",
    "    - Holds the ball on the ground for the kicker to kick.\n",
    "- <b>Long Snapper</b>\n",
    "    - Similar to a center but for special teams, a long snapper snaps the ball to the holder.\n",
    "- <b>Punter</b>\n",
    "    - Responsible for punting the ball on punt plays. Some punters kick for kickoffs.\n",
    "- <b>Kick/Punt Returner</b>\n",
    "    - A receiving team's player who catches and returns the ball on kickoffs and punts. Usually the kick/punt returner is a young wide receiver who either is not in the starting lineup or does not play a large role during offensive plays.\n",
    "- <b>Upback</b>\n",
    "    - Upbacks protect the punter, acting as the last line of defense to ensure the punt is not blocked.\n",
    "- <b>Gunner</b>\n",
    "    - Players designated in running down the field to tackle the kick/punt returner.\n",
    "- <b>Jammer</b>\n",
    "    - Players designated to block the gunners."

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General information about Quarterback statistics\n",
    "Quarterbacks are usually separated into 2 types: a gunslinger and a game manager. A gunslinger is characterized as a quarterback who loves to take risks, often throwing many long passes and risky passes that can either result in big plays or an interception. A game manager usually has a negative connotation attached and is a quarterback who mainly attempts safe, short passes. Game managers are usually afraid to take risks such as throwing long passes and are considered to be quarterbacks who try not to make mistakes and fail to make their teammates better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The best quarterbacks are usually a mixture of a gunslinger and a game manager. These quarterbacks are able to throw quick, accurate passes while also being able to make the big plays. They are able to read the defenses to determine the best option on any given play. A quarterback with these skills are considered to be elite, but there are few elite quarterbacks in the NFL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically, a quarterback may be considered to have a great game if he is able to throw for 250 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions. If a quarterback is able to achieve these marks each game over the course of a 16 game season, he would end the season with 4000 passing yards and 32 touchdowns, but no quarterback achieves these ideal stats. It is hotly debated what an elite quarterback's stats should be. Usually, over 4000 passing yards is considered great for a quarterback. The number of touchdowns and interceptions a quarterback throws and a quarterback's TD:INT ratio always has to be taken into context. A quarterback may throw 30 touchdowns and 20 interceptions in a season and have a lower TD:INT ratio than a quaterback who threw for 15 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. In general, a TD:INT ratio over 2 is considered to be great given that there is enough volume. A general baseline for a great/elite quarterback would be 30 or more touchdowns and 10 or fewer interceptions over the course of a 16 game season. However, other factors like personnel and team's win-loss must be taken into consideration when determining if a quarterback is elite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "All of the data we are using in this project comes from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/. For this project, we extracted the quarterback passing and rushing statistics from the 2013-2017 seasons. We chose not to include the 2018 NFL season because the season is still in progress.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Passer Rating\n",
    "In general, passer rating is a good general way to measure a quarterback's performance, but it is still a flawed measurement. A good comparison would be using BMI to measure one's health. BMI does not take into account body fat percentage, thus many fit, muscular athletes are categorized as overweight or obese when they are in fact very fit and healthy. Passer rating is a good screen test for a quarterback's performance, but a player's passer rating and statistics must be taken into context before completely judging a quarterback's abilties and performance in the NFL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum possible passer rating in the NFL is 158.3, indicating that a quarterback had a near perfect game. In general, a passer rating of 100+ indicates an excellent performance, 90-100 usually indicates a good quarterback, between 80-90 would be about an average quarterback and anything below 80 indicates a below average quarterback. The league average passer rating in the 2017 NFL season was 88.6, but remember that these are general ranges and passer rating is not a conclusive indicator of a quarterback's performance and abilties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The passer rating formula is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a =  (\\frac{COMP}{ATT} - 0.3)\\times 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = (\\frac{YDS}{ATT} - 3)\\times 0.25$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c = (\\frac{TD}{ATT} - 0.3)\\times 20$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d = 2.375 - ((\\frac{COMP}{ATT} - 0.3)\\times 25)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- <b>ATT</b> = Number of passing attempts\n",
    "- <b>COMP</b> = Number of completions\n",
    "- <b>YDS</b> = Number of passing yards\n",
    "- <b>TD</b> = Number of touchdown passes\n",
    "- <b>INT</b> = Number of interceptions thrown\n",

    "#### How Football Statistics are recorded\n",

    "This correlation matrix of the variables shows that we have a very large dimension space. We want to reduce this by using a dimensionality reduction algorithm to find more meaningful results in our data. Our dataset is relatively small, and we have a large number of variables so we want to tackle the curse of dimensionality without losing any of the information present in our data. We can see that almost all of the variables are at least slightly correlated with the rest (most with correlations of > 0.2). We can see that Int% and Sk% are negatively correlated with the rest of the variables, which makes sense because those 2 are indicators of bad performance while high values of the other variables are generally good performance indicators.\n",

We are not losing any information in the data, which would happen if we were doing feature selection (methods such as best subset, forward/backwards stepwise), but just compressing our data into a smaller, easier-to-understand format."

Some of these quarterbacks have very high yards/games but they are not often considered elite becuase their production is often attributed to very good personnel around them or a pass-heavy gameplan (such as Matt Stafford) It is interesting to see Cam Newton appear many times on this as well, as many may consider him elite, but our analysis favored pass-heavy quarterbacks over rush-heavy quarterbacks."
